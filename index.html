			<td>HTML5</td>
			<td>HTML5 coding is clear, simple, and descriptive. ... HTML5 also makes placing audio and video content a breeze.

			<td>3</td>
			<td>CSS</td>
			<td>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.</td>

		<tr>
			<td>5</td>
			<td>Javascript</td>
			<td>JavaScript Enhances Your Web page. In all appropriate uses of JavaScript, the purpose of the JavaScript is to enhance the way the web page works and to provide those of your visitors who have JavaScript enabled with a friendlier site than is possible without the JavaScript.</td>

By design, it is a carrier for information that needs to be incorporated into a document.</td>
